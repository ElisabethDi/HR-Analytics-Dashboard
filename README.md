##  File Type Note: `.xlsm` & GitHub Repository Management

- Excel macro-enabled files (`.xlsm`) are fully supported in GitHub—users can download and open them without issue. GitHub handles `.xlsm` files like any other binary file.  


- **Limitations in version control:**  
  Since `.xlsm` is a binary format, GitHub cannot display detailed diffs or track content changes between versions directly within the interface.
